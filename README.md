# Bank OCR kata
My Javascript/Node solution to [Bank OCR from Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/) with a 3 hour time limit

Solves for User Story 1 - 3

Ran out of time for User Story 4 but this is still more than an MVP for the overall need.

## Install
```
npm install mocha
mkdir processedOCR
```

## Available Scripts

### `npm run start filename.txt`

Loads the specified file to read and convert to account numbers before outputting to a processedOCR folder

### `npm run test`

Runs the available tests
